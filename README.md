# AI-for-Renewable-Energy-Optimization

With economic growth in the Global South comes a surging demand for energy. However, the reliance on fossil fuels is unsustainable. AI is enabling the transition to renewable energy by predicting and optimizing energy generation from solar and wind power.

    Atlas AI and ENGIE Energy Access use machine learning models to identify off-grid communities where renewable energy mini-grids can be most effectively deployed (World Resources Institute, 2024).
    In India, AI-driven predictive maintenance for solar farms has reduced downtime and boosted energy efficiency by 15% (IRENA, 2023), ensuring a stable energy supply.
